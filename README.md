## Git and Github Intro

Git and github are essential for saving and sharing your code. While writing code, whenever you get your program working properly you'll want to save that version of the program. Git helps you do that. It's kind of like git takes a snapshot of your code whenever you tell it to. Imagine you are coding along, and suddenly EVERYTHING is broken. What would you do? If you used git and saved your work along the way, you could essentially rewind your code history to a working version. 

Here is what we will be covering in this lesson:

* what git and github are and what they do
* how to track changes to your code locally, on your computer, using git
* how to store and share code on Github.com
* best practices for collaborating with other developers on github through forking, cloning and pull requests
