## Git and GitHub Intro

**Git** and **GitHub** are essential tools for saving and sharing your code. When a group of people get together to write a program, they all have to work on the same files. But what's the best way to deal with the confusion that might arise when multiple people are changing code in the same file? That's where git and GitHub come in. 

Whenever you get your program working properly, it's important to save that version of the program, right?  _The cool thing about git and GitHub is that these tools remember exactly what your code looked like at each moment you choose to save it_. It's kind of like git takes a snapshot of your code whenever you want it to. Imagine you are coding along, and suddenly EVERYTHING is broken. What would you do? If you used git and saved your work along the way, you could essentially rewind your code history back to a working version. 

Here is what we will be covering in this lesson:
* **what git and GitHub are** and what they do
* how to **track changes to your code locally**, on your computer, using git
* how to **store and share code on [github.com](github.com)**
* best practices for collaborating with other developers on GitHub through **forking, cloning, and pull requests**
